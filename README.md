# Basic-Server
This is a basic html server. the jar file created on build opens up a window. you click the start button, select your servers root directory and the server loads. This server pre-processes the files and compresses them on load. Due to this, the server can take up to 2 minutes to load while it compiles all the html files into singletons.
